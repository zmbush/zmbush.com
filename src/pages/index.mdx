I'm Zachary Bush, and I work as a Software Engineer helping to develop [Fuchsia][fuchsia]. Before
that I was a Site Reliability Engineer at [Google][google], and before that I was a Member of
Technical Staff at [Cisco Meraki][meraki], and in 2013, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree
in computer science.

Long before all of that, however, I turned 11 and forced myself to accept that I was, unfortunately,
not a wizard. Not willing to accept that there was no magic in the world I turned to computers and
tried to invent my own.

My first foray into the world of programming came when I convinced my parents to give me one of
their unused Palm Pilots. With that I was able to start learning my first programming language:
[SmallBASIC][small-basic]. What I was able to produce in those days was understandably crude, but it
lit a fire in me that has yet to go out. Since then I have worked with many programming languages,
ranging from Visual Basic and C# to C++ and Java, and finally to my current lingual obsession:
[](tech:rust). All of this leads me to have a nearly constant stream of new [Personal
Projects][projects].

At times, when I am able to tear myself away from my computer screen, I also have many hobbies. I
enjoy hiking, flying kites, and biking. I cook often, play guitar, play with Legos, and spend time
with my friends and [partner](partner:molly). I also love spending time visiting with my family,
including my baby nephew [Landon][landon], and Harper.
