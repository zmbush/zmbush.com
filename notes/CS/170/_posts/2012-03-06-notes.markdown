# Set Cover

K lists that cover.

    [.....]
    [.....]
    [.....]
    [.....]

Except for the other lists. 

The greedy algorithm is not optimal, but will find a very good solution. 

> This problem is ***NP-Complete***. 

The greedy algorithm picks the set with the most remaining elements. 

* not optimal, but will perform fine.

## How fine?

The optimal has k sets.

The greedy alway picks at least 1/k remaining elements.

    After Step 1:
      Elements remaining <= n(1 - 1/k)
    After Step 2:
      Elements remaining <= n(1 - 1/k)^2
    After Step k:
      Elements remaining <= n(1 - 1/k)^k = 1/e = 37% < 1/2
    After Step klogn:
      Elements remaining = 0

> There is a solition that has k, therefore we will allways have an element of
size (1/k) which is a set from the optimal solution. The greedy will always try
to do better.
