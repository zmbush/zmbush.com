## Hello!

My name is Zach Bush, thanks for visiting my website today!

### School

I am currently in my final semester at the University of California at Berkeley.
I am a computer science major in the College of Letters and Sciences.

### Work

I work part-time at [Meraki] [meraki], which was recently acquired by [Cisco
systems] [cisco]. I also work as a undergraduate student instructor for [CS61C]
[cs61c], which deals with the internal organization of computers as well as
elements of parallelism and scalability.

Previously, I have worked as a math tutor at [Sierra College] [sierra], and as a
CS tutor for Java, C++, Bash, Python, and data structures at UC Berkeley. I have
also done consulting work for [Indowsway Software] [indowsway] (where I worked
on maintaining a library of FORTRAN bindings for WinAPI) and [Berkeley
Simulation Software][bss] (where I worked on the company's product Rail Traffic
Controller, as well as updating their website).

### Fun times

In my free time (of which I have almost none) I enjoy working on [hobby coding
projects] [projects], as well as occasional hardware hacking. I like to go on
hikes, bike rides, and other things of the sort, regretfully, not as often as I
once did. I also play the guitar (poorly).

I like to cook, hang out with [my five roommates][Roomies], and play with
Legos. I love visiting with my family, especially my baby nephew
[Landon][landy].
