## Hello!

My name is Zach Bush, thanks for visiting my website today!

### School

I am currently in my final semester at the University of California at Berkeley.
I am a computer science major in the college of letters and sciences.

### Work

I work part-time at [Meraki] [meraki], which was recently acquired by [Cisco
systems] [cisco] I also work as a undergraduate student instructor for [CS61C]
[cs61c], which deals with the internal organization of computers as well as
elements of parallelism and scalability.

Previously, I have worked as a math tutor at [Sierra College] [sierra], and as a
CS tutor for Java, C++, Bash, Python, and data structures at UC Berkeley. I have
also done consulting work for [Indowsway Software] [indowsway] (where I worked
on maintaining a library of FORTRAN bindings for WinAPI) and [Berkeley
Simulation Software][bss] (Where I worked on the company's product Rail Traffic
Controller, as well as updating their website)

### Fun times

In my free time, of which I have almost none, I enjoy working on [hobby coding
projects] [projects], as well as occasional hardware hacking. I like to go on
hikes, bike rides, and other things of the sort, regretfully, not as often as I
once did. I also play the guitar (poorly).

I like to cook, and often do so for my five roommates, and I love legos. I like
hanging out with my roommates, and visiting my family, Especially my nephew
[landon] [landy].
