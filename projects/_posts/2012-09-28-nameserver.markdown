I started working on this project while in my networking class at
berkeley. We were talking about nameservers and it sounded cool, so I
started obsessing (as I am oft to do) and ended up with this exciting
thing. I also got a bit obsessed with writing tests, so I started using
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/zipcodeman/nameserver).
