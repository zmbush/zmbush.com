This was a 3 hour coding project to take a set of reviews taken from the Yelp
website, and use that as training data for a program to determine the number
of stars a rating will give. 

Each item in the dataset represents a review with the full text of the review,
the number of stars given, the business that the review is for, the person who
reviewed it and more. 

What we did was, we looked at the words in the review and averaged the number
of stars that were associated with that word. We then threw out any word that
was too close to the middle (3 stars) and kept the rest. 

To then predict the rating of a review, we first take the average review given
to that business, and then based on the words used in the review, either raised
or lowered the value of the stars. 

With this we were able to get a Root Mean Squared error of around 1.079, which
was an improvement on the naive approach.
