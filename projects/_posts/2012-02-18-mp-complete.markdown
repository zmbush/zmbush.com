## .mp-Complete 

This was a project for the 2012 CSUA hackathon. An 18 hour programming
competition that began at 6:00 PM on February 17th, and ended at noon the
following day. 

The goal was to create a tool where a user could simply take mp3 files that were
missing metadata such as song title, artist, genre, or lyrics. 

Using public APIs such as echonest, musixmatch, and eyeD3. We were able to
create a system to simply drop music onto the website, upload it, and
re-download the repaired song.
