I started this project in late 2011 on a whim. I was feeling sick and I had
gone home early, out of boredom, I started working on this project.

After several hours, I managed to have a working product that did what I
wanted. Over the next couple days, I worked on it to make it better and fix
bugs.

The project is still being worked on and off. The most recent update adding
support for notifications when professors post new grades.

You can download the app from the [Google Play Store][play-store].
