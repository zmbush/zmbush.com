Hi! I'm Zach Bush, and welcome to my personal website. I'm a graduate from [](org:cal) and currently
employed as a Software Engineer at [](org:google) working on [](job:fuchsia), a new open-sourced
operating system that is currently running on [all first-generation Google Nest
Hubs][fuchsia-launch] around the world, replacing Cast OS. In addition to my paid employment, I do
many [personal projects][projects] on the side.

My first foray into the world of programming came when I convinced my parents to give me one of
their unused Palm Pilots. With that I was able to start learning my first programming language:
[](tech:small-basic). From there I went on to learn Visual Basic, C#, C++, and Java before even
leaving high school. In my last couple years of high school, I began working professionally as a
Fortran developer for [](job:bss), and as a C++ developer for [](job:indowsway).

From there, I attended two years at [](org:sierra), before transferring to [](org:cal) and
completing my BA in Computer Science in 2013. While in school I worked as both a math tutor at
Sierra College, and as a [GSI for CS61C][cs61c] while at Cal. After graduating, I worked for a few
years at [](org:meraki) working on web development, [app development][meraki-app], and was one of
the principal developers on the company's ill-fated android-based desk phone the [MC74][mc74] up
until its launch in 2016. After which, I left to work at [](job:google) as a Site Reliability
Engineer, for 4 years until I began work on [](job:fuchsia).

At times, when I am able to tear myself away from my computer screen, I also have many hobbies. I
enjoy hiking, flying kites, and biking. I am trying to teach myself woodworking, piano, and music
production. I like to to cook, write, and make art. I love spending time with my friends and
[partner](partner:molly). I also, when I can, love visiting with my family, including my three
niblings [Landon][landon], Harper, and Brock.
