KlassifiedKringle was created in late 2020 for a secret santa gift exchange in a
discord server. The data was collected via a google sheet, and then loaded into
the bot, which then randomized the assignments, and sent them all out as direct
messages. This bot allowed easily assigning people their giftee without any one
member seeing the full list.
