Noted was created with one simple goal: to make writing for d&d as simple and
straightforward as possible. I attempted to accomplish this with a few core
features that I did not find in other world building applications I had come
across.

# Simple, unstructured 'notes'

One of the core design considerations of noted was that everything should be a
'note'. Character? Note. Location? Note. Quest line? Note. With this design,
there's no worrying about what type of thing you are creating, you just name it
and add some contents. The contents are written using a simple markdown-based
wysiwyg editor.

# Notes are created/nested easily

Similar to the way that notes are simple and unstructured. Adding notes is also
very simple. There's a couple methods:

1. Search for a non-existent note, and pressing enter
2. Clicking the add sub-note button

This way notes can be created quickly, and easily. In addition, the nesting of
notes allows related concepts to easily be grouped together without a single
note getting overly long.

# Automatically link to notes

Finally, the most important feature. This was basically the whole reason I
created noted in the first place. Whenever a note's title is mentioned in
another note, they are automatically linked to each other. This seems like a
simple feature, but it trivially creates a knowledge base of interlinked notes.
