This was a project for the 2012 CSUA hackathon. An eighteen hour programming competition that began
at 6:00 p.m. on February 17th, and ended at noon the following day.

The goal was to create a tool where a user could simply take mp3 files that were missing metadata
such as song title, artist, genre, or lyrics.

Using public APIs such as echonest, musixmatch, and eyeD3. We created a system where you could drop
music into a box on the website which would upload it, and repair all the metadata.
