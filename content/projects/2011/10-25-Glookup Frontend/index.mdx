I started this project in late 2011 on a whim. I was feeling sick and I had gone home early, out of
boredom, I started working on this project.

After several hours, I managed to have a working product that did what I wanted. Over the next
couple days, I worked on it to make it better and fix bugs.

The project is still being worked on and off. The most recent update adding support for
notifications when professors post new grades.

You can download the app from the [Google Play Store][play-store].
