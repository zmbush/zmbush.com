In early 2021, the ["My First Game Jam"][mfgj] was hosted on itch.io, welcoming all first-time game
developers. As with many, I have toyed with the idea of making a video game many times over the
years, but had never actually gotten around to it. This game jam, hosted over the course of 2 weeks
in late January 2021 seemed like a perfect opportunity.

# The Engine: [Bevy](tech:bevy)

Months prior, I had been dabbling with the very new (Only at `v0.4.0` at the time) [rust](tech:rust)
game engine: [](tech:bevy). The engine didn't have many of the quality of life features one would
expect from a full-featured game engine like Unreal or Unity, but that wasn't a problem for me. The
part of game development (at the time) that most interested me was more the nitty gritty of the
various systems. How did graphics work? How do you handle assets? How do you implement dialog
systems and quest lines? While a more mature engine would have let me make this game in likely half
or less of the time, I wasn't really interested in what I saw as a shortcut.

[](tech:bevy) uses the "ECS" or _Entity_, _Component_, _System_ model of game development. The
benefit of that system is that it strongly encourages modularity by making each element of the game
world a simple object (_Component_), group of objects (_Entity_), or function (_System_). In Bevy, a
_Component_ could be as simple as this plain rust `struct` for tracking player data:

```rust
pub struct Player {
    pub moving: bool,
    pub impulse: Vec3,
}
```

<Caption>
  A simple <code className='language-rust'>Player</code> component that keeps track of data relevant
  to a player.

_Systems_ as well are very simple. Their whole purpose is to perform operations on the data stored
in the Entities, and since they are just plain rust functions, there continues to be a strong
incentive to modularize. In _New York 2121_ there were some _Systems_ that were as short as 3 lines
long, like this one:

```rust {2-4}
fn update_moving_state(mut player_query: Query<&mut Player>) {
    for mut player in player_query.iter_mut() {
        player.moving = player.impulse.x != 0. || player.impulse.y != 0.;
    }
}
```

# Asset Creation

All those nice features aside, [](tech:bevy) didn't really have any sort of good interface for
designing levels or assets. To supplement the engine, I chose to use [](tech:aseprite) for editing
pixel art and sprites, and [](tech:tiled) for map creation.

## Sprites: [Aseprite](tech:aseprite)

I started with a [sprite sheet][kenney] from itch.io, and modified it to support the visual style I
was going for. I'm not an artist by any stretch, and I got a lot of help from my collaborator and
story writer [](partner:molly), but I think the sprite sheet turned out surprisingly cohesive:

![The Game's Tilemap](./tilemap.png 'I started with a sprite sheet and added to it')

## Map Creation: [Tiled](tech:tiled)

Then came the assembling of the tilemap I'd created into a level. [](tech:bevy) at this point did
not have any sort of level editor, so I turned to [](tech:tiled), which seemed to be a pretty good
option for a 2d top-down game. A few hours in tiled were all it took to have a rudimentary map for
my game. The next step, then, was to integrate the map that Tiled generated into Bevy.
Unfortunately, I did not like any of the existing Tiled integrations for bevy, so I ended up
building my own, which involved cobbling together some custom shaders to support rendering a the
tilemap, and custom parsing logic to handle the XML file that Tiled produced.

```glsl
void main() {
  int sprite_number = Tilemap[Vertex_Tile_Index];
  if (sprite_number == 0) {
    return;
  }
  Rect sprite_rect = Textures[sprite_number - 1];
  vec2 sprite_dimensions = sprite_rect.end - sprite_rect.begin;
  vec3 vertex_position = vec3(
    Vertex_Position.xy * sprite_dimensions,
    0.0
  );
  vec2 atlas_positions[4] = vec2[](
    vec2(sprite_rect.begin.x, sprite_rect.end.y),
    sprite_rect.begin,
    vec2(sprite_rect.end.x, sprite_rect.begin.y),
    sprite_rect.end
  );

  v_Uv = floor(atlas_positions[gl_VertexIndex % 4] + vec2(0.01, 0.01)) / AtlasSize;
  v_Color = Color;
  gl_Position = ViewProj * ChunkTransform * vec4(ceil(vertex_position), 1.0);
}
```

Once I had all of that in place, I (and my collaborator) could easily edit the map and sprites. I
used Tiled to encode event triggers and collision zones, and from there I was able to have a little
character walking around in the city I had designed. Then I ran into the final big hurdle.

# The Dialog System

You see, my plan for this game was to make it a sort of RPG-lite, so I needed dialog, quest lines,
and items. The problem was that my story writer was not a programmer, so embedding the dialog in the
rust code was not an option (and, in retrospect, would have made development much slower).

I looked into several dialog systems including [Yarn Spinner][yarnspinner], but found them to both
be more complicated than I needed, and none of them had rust libraries. So I once again implemented
my own! I took some of the features I liked from Yarn Spinner (like their method of linking parts of
a conversation together), and added the [Handlebars][handlebars] templating system, and produced a
sort of proto-language that My writer could easily edit and add their content to.

```handlebars
# Quest 1: Robert Ruelas -> Rat Whistle
quest :: ruelas_jacket = Get Robert's jacket
item :: ruelas_jacket  = Robert's Puffy jacket
item :: rat_whistle    = Rat Whistle
char :: robert         = Robert Ruelas

:: see_ruelas_car while quest.ruelas_jacket
{{ #unless visited.ruelas_car }}
  There is a car over there, maybe it's !!Robert's!!.
{{ /unless }}

:: ruelas_car
{{ #if quest.ruelas_jacket }}
  {{ #unless items.ruelas_jacket }}
    You find a !!jacket!! in the back seat.
    It's a waterproof, blue down jacket with a New York City Government badge on it.
    <<get_quest|ruelas_jacket>>
    <<get_item|ruelas_jacket>>
    ...
```

Finally, I had all of the elements needed, to build my game, and only a few days left to complete
it. I had thankfully chosen a game jam that was 2 weeks long, rather than the 2-3 days of your
[Ludum Dare][ludumdare] or other such jams. Since I ended up implementing so much of the needed
scaffolding on my own during the jam, I really needed the extra time. In the end, I created a game
that I am very happy with despite its short runtime.
