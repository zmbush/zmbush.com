In mid-2015, I was looking into the prospect of buying a house. I realized, that
while I had a fairly reasonable income, I had no real idea how much money I was
saving, and how much I was spending on what. I had been using [Mint][mint] for a
while, and though it allowed me to see all of my accounts in one place, it did
not include my partner's financial information, and its implementation of a
rolling budget left something to be desired.

All these things caused me to make "Budgetron" a system written in [rust][rust],
with a frontend in javascript/[React][react] that allowed me to track more
clearly and consistently my expenses over time, while assigning a monthly
rolling budget for spending on miscellaneous purchases, where excess money rolls
over to the next month, and excess expenses cut into next month's budget. This
rolling budget allows easily setting an 'average' amount of money spent per
month, while still allowing large purchases when desired.
