Many people tend to want to pack as much information as densely as possible into
their prompt line, often abbreviating information and omitting less relevant
data. Most of these prompts expect to be rendered on a single line, so brevity is
of the utmost import.

When I created [pyprompt][pyprompt] back in 2012, I did not care about any of
these concerns. My only concern was packing as much information into the prompt
as possible, including current git branch, modified/staged files, and more.

Over the years of using pyprompt, however, I found its performance to be lacking
(and I wanted to experiment with this newish language rust), so in late 2014 I
began a project to rewrite pyprompt in rust, a project I dubbed megaprompt.

It took me a couple months to implements suitable replacement for pyprompt, and
it was an excellent learning opportunity. It also represented my first foray
into Rust which has since become my favorite and go-to language for any new
project.
